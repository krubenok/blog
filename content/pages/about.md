# Hi, I'm Kyle

If you've landed here, you're probably wondering who I am, and what this is. Well, I'm Kyle Rubenok, and this is my blog. I'm currently a 5th year student at McGill University in the bitterly cold city of Montreal studying Computer Science with a minor in Economics and currently a PM Intern over at Microsoft.

This blog won't have any particular theme beyond whatever I feel like writing about in the moment. I mostly think about technology or things technology adjacent so I except this blog will be similar. Specifically, I'm a fan of enterprise hardware and homelabbing, macOS/iOS/iPadOS/watchOS, and love to needlessly automate things. Oh and I like to ski fast sometimes.
